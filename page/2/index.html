<ol>
<li>Less configuration (no mapping file, no design model, no need to create table first)</li>
<li>Easier to write code (no need to build complicated model or query)</li>
<li>With some extra configuration, the generated/target database can be adapted to DBA’s requirements. At least, the difficulty is less than the opposite way.</li>

            <h2 id="Knowledge-to-support-practice"><a href="#Knowledge-to-support-practice" class="headerlink" title="Knowledge to support practice"></a>Knowledge to support practice</h2><blockquote>
<p>I chose software as my research direction from the third year of university under the influence of “data structure” course. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>As what the name suggests, the course helped me understand two basic elements of a program: data structure and algorithms, and their relationship.</p>
<p>The order of growth (𝛩-notation) is the most fundamental concept to help understand why various data structures and algorithms are designed. For instance, most programming languages provide support for array or list, which stores data in a sequence of blocks of memory. The expectation of the time to look for an item in an array is 𝛩(n). It is an efficient data structure for cases that the number of the items are small. But there are exceptions.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>When debugging a radiology information system (2015), I found a search function of an array is extremely slow. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>The function looks for an external system in an array of dozens of items. The root cause is that each item is persistent as a JSON object. During the search, each item needs to be parsed and converted into an object tree. So even with only dozens of items, the array is still not a good choice. My approach is to use a hash table as a memory cache. Hash table is a table with (key, value) pair and has 𝛩(1) for search operation. I put the identity of an external system into the hash table as key, the parsed object as value (so each item will be parsed once during the lifetime of the application). As a result, the change improves the performance more than 100 times.</p>
<p>But hash table is not the answer to all criteria. In a task (2014), I was asked to build an index for billing codes (the total number can be over 100K in some countries). Supposing the billing number is chose as the index property, then one billing code needs 4 bytes (32 bits). The total of billing codes will result in 400K of memory usage. What is more, hash table needs at least twice of the capacity to put hash key, which means the whole index needs to consume 1M of memory. So even with the expectation time of 𝛩(1) for search operation, hash table is not suitable in this case (bitmap is used instead).</p>
<p>I am also familiar with other data structures such as trees and graphs. I spent much time building parser and processor for HL7 / DICOM messages, which are certain kinds of tree. The common strategies to visit a tree are deep first search (DFS), breadth first search (BFS) and hill climbing search. The basic approach to solve tree-related problems is divide-and-conquer and recursion. That is to divide the question domain into multiple sub-domains, repeat the step recursively until sub-domain is small enough and a straightforward solution appears. The final step is to combine the solutions together. The approach can prove by Mathematical Induction that the overall cost can be much better than the solution of brute force. For example, supposing we divide the domain into two parts and need 𝛩(n) to combine the results, then the overall cost is 𝛩(n lgn).</p>
<p>Regarding graph, it shares some common algorithms with tree but has its own specific use. I was once asked to calculate a path on an image of Digital Radiography (DR) study. The path needs to go through a group of points on the image. This is a shortest-path problem in a graph, just as how a navigating system finds a route on a map. The approach is to take the points as a network and divide them into multiple layers so that in each layer there are very few points and I can use brute-force to loop through all of them to get a local solution. I use the greedy algorithm to decide how many layers I need. And the final step is to combine local solutions together.</p>
<p>Generally speaking, the knowledge of data structure and algorithm gives me the ability to design complex computation units. And I also gained knowledge about software engineering theory and object-oriented design principles, which gives me the ability to organise these computation units.</p>
<h2 id="Systematic-understanding"><a href="#Systematic-understanding" class="headerlink" title="Systematic understanding"></a>Systematic understanding</h2><blockquote>
<p>I took an elementary course of “software engineering” (2000) and a programming course (2001) based on Java technology for my bachelor degree. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Waterfall model was used in the course at that time, which borrows idea from manufacturing workflows. It treats software development as sequential processes (analysis, design, implementation, testing and maintenance). In practice, software projects following this method have a high rate of failure due to the frequently changed requirements. For example, the problem found during the test phase can be a disaster for development team because it can cause a large scale of code refactoring or even the change to the design model. As a result, after leaving university two years, I took software engineering course (2003-2006) for a master’s degree. The courses include Introduction to Software Engineering, Software Project Management, Software and System Rapid Prototyping, Software Quality Assurance, Software Implementation and Testing and Software Maintenance and Re-engineering Evolution.</p>
<p>In this period, Agile methodology emerged as an answer to the limitation of Waterfall model. I involved in many discussions of this topic. Generally, I believe Agile method is a repetitive waterfall model but with two good practices: Test-Driven development and refactoring. In an Agile method, we still follow sequential processes but repeat them every a certain period of time. On one hand, big features can be split into small tasks which can be scheduled in multiple cycles. And tasks with smaller scope tend to be easier to tackle. That is the idea of divide-and-conquer algorithm. On the other hand, product owner can give feedback to the product at the end of each cycle so that developer can improve it in next cycle. It acts as a feedback system for software projects just as the Nyquist stability criterion in control theory and stability theory, which reduces the cost of doing change compared to that in waterfall model. I have more than 6 years of experience in a Scrum team, working on a big project with cross-site cooperation and have the chance to practice what I learned in the above software engineering courses.</p>

<p>Regarding programming skills, I got Java certificated programmer in 2001. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Java was a young programming language at that time but I believe object-oriented design would be a trend. As a high-level programming language, Java language has a clear syntax and good support in open-source community. That is the reason why I invested a large amount of time in this technology. Most projects that I took part in were based on Java platform (2003-2006). Meanwhile, I also took a series of courses in object-oriented development: Object-oriented Method, Software Modelling and Design, Object-oriented Formal Methods, which improve my ability to design flexible software systems.</p>

            <h2 id="Define-key-information-in-fundamental-engineering"><a href="#Define-key-information-in-fundamental-engineering" class="headerlink" title="Define key information in fundamental engineering"></a>Define key information in fundamental engineering</h2><p>My specialization is computer science and software engineering, and my knowledge of this part starts from Turning machine, a mathematical model of computation. </p>
<blockquote>
<p>From the “computer composition” course, I learned that a Turning machine is a Finite State Machine (FSM) and consists of a number of functions, which is able to change FSM from one state to another based on the input. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>A more general concept, Universal Turning Machine (UTM), is a Turning machine that can turn into any Turning machine with the description of the target machine as input. It means we don’t need to build specific machines for specific tasks.</p>
<p>For me, the theory of Turning machine has influence in two areas. One is that it helps to understand the modern computer systems (which I will describe later). The other is “Turning complete”, a way to measure the capability of a computer. There are four elements in “Turning complete”: unlimited storage, ability to do arithmetic, evaluation with condition and the support of repetition of execution. They are mandatory for a model with maximum capability of computation. Once we find them in a model, we can prove it has reached the limit of computation and therefore is “Turning complete”. That is the reason why I spent a large amount of time in my dissertation of a model-based framework (2005) to implement functional programming (or formally Lambda calculus) in an imperative programming language. Recently (2014), I implemented a Domain Specific Language (DSL) for healthcare business and filled a gap using this thesis.</p>
<p>Modern computer systems consist of a number of modules and sub modules, including Central Processing Unit (CPU), storage, the controllers to manage input / output devices and other external devices such as monitor, printer, massive storage (hard disk), network and so on. These modules talk to each other by an electronic pipeline called “bus”. In fact, the concept of bus is so widely used that it affects the design of software. For example, I prefer using event bus to connect multiple components to achieve the result of loose coupling. It builds communication between components without introducing strong dependency. It can also be used in the mode of “subscribe and publish”, which can further improve the flexibility of a system. For example, I worked in a Model-View-Controller (MVC) application. Controller receives data from model and updates view. Meanwhile, it talks to other controllers via an event bus so that all parts of User Interface (UI) get updated.</p>
<p>Another concept that gives me inspiration is cache. Compared to high-speed of CPU, storage works much slowly. In normal usage, computer system sends the large amount of data between modules and it is very likely to be the bottleneck of the system. The solution is to provide a high-speed cache to keep temporary data. Bear the concept of cache in mind, I designed a connectivity component with compiled expression tree in memory (instead of in database) to improve the network throughput. (2013)</p>
<p>Computation happens inside a CPU, so the understanding of CPU plays an important role. </p>
<blockquote>
<p>In “digital logic&amp;logic design” course, I learned how to design a CPU with Hardware Description Language (HDL). </p>
</blockquote>
<p>It uses logic gates as an elementary unit and based on the theory of Boolean algebra, logic gates can form into large computational block called combinational circuit to implement complex logic. Emulators are used to run the compiled HDL and the result can be verified without creating a real Integrated Circuit.</p>
<p>Once CPU is ready, we can give it instructions to do computation. For this purpose, every CPU has been designed to understand a language called machine language. </p>

<p>“Assembly language” course gives me knowledge about how to do programming with this low-level language. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>For most software engineers, it is not the most commonly used language but it can be used by a middle-level language (e.g., C) to provide a hardware specific (or performance critical) solution. It also helps when fine-tuning a program written in higher level languages. Through the analysis to the generated assembly code, I can optimize the source code of higher-level language by changing the configuration of the compiler. </p>
<blockquote>
<p>It also involves the knowledge of “compiling principles”. I took my first programming course, “fundamentals of programming”, in the second term and C programming language was used as teaching material, which is a middle-level language. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>It has a clear syntax and provides an abstract layer for hardware, which enables me to focus on business logic (data structures and algorithms) instead of the details of how to manipulate hardware. It also helps to improve the program’s portability with less chance of incompatible issue. C programming language can be used to build drivers and provide Application Program Interface (API) for high-level languages to control hardware. It still has a large population of developers worldwide and is heavily used in the development of embedded systems and home automation.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I took “Operating System” (OS) course in the third year and an extension course (advanced UNIX programming) during my master’s degree. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Basically, OS stays on top of hardware and provides service to access CPU, storage and I/O devices. OS also has a scheduling system to run multiple programs simultaneously. Process is a running program with the exclusive use of a virtual memory space. OS cuts clock time into small slices and chooses a waiting process to run in each slice. Inside one process, thread is a lightweight solution for concurrent computation. I have some experience in performance fine-tuning for multi-thread program during the project of online auction.</p>
<p>The concepts of process and virtual memory space play an important role in understanding programming languages. In fact, it involves a number of pitfalls that I was not aware of them until I worked for Kodak digital cinema division, where I spent much time debugging memory use of a video player.</p>
<p>The top part of the virtual memory is for stacks, which is used when a program invokes a function. Each stack will be allocated with local variables and a return address. When the program returns from the function call, the stack will be deallocated. For local variables of value-type, they will be cleared along with the stack. For those of reference-type, their reference pointers in the stack will be cleared, but not the data in the heap (which is allocated via system function malloc). This is one of root causes of memory leak. </p>
<h2 id="Fundamentals-to-solve-complex-engineering-problems"><a href="#Fundamentals-to-solve-complex-engineering-problems" class="headerlink" title="Fundamentals to solve complex engineering problems"></a>Fundamentals to solve complex engineering problems</h2><p>Different technologies have different solutions. Either programmer need to free the data in the heap manually (e.g., C and C++), or rely on reference counter implemented inside the runtime of the language (e.g., Object C). A more advanced (but may slower) solution is that the runtime performs a scan on the heap at regular intervals, looking for all allocated memory that have no external reference and mark them as candidates for garbage collection (e.g., Java, Javascript, C#).</p>
<p>Another pitfall comes from the misunderstanding of how parameters are passed during function call. If they are passed as values, then the program has to do copy for these parameters before doing the function call. If they are passed as references, only the reference pointers have to be copied, not including the data in the heap.</p>
<p>Without the understanding of stack and heap, it is unlikely to be successful in software development. That is the reason why I always pay attention to how programming languages do memory management.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I learned from the course of “Network” about the TCP/IP protocol suite. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>The model of abstraction layers (link, internet, transport and application) has wide influence on the multi-layer architecture of software such as JavaEE core pattern, which in turn is a reference of my model-based framework “SGMF”. I also acquired knowledge about cryptography, which was used in a project of online auction (X.509 certification authority and Denial of Service), in a project of video player with embedded chip (RSA).</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I learned from the course of “Database” about Entity Relationship (ER) model and database normalisation, which give me the ability to design database in online auction project, connectivity module of healthcare system and other projects. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>The knowledge of structured query language (SQL) gives me the ability to fine-tune programs with object relationship mapping (ORM) frameworks such as “Hibernate”, JPA and ADO.net Entity (I wrote an article about how to do ORM in Entity framework with samples from real projects in my Github blog). A recent case was that on an Oracle database, I replaced “sysdate” with “currentTimestamp” in a database query to fix a subtle issue happened only when database and application are installed with different time zones.</p>
<p>To sum up, these courses give me the fundamental knowledge to continue the study of specialist courses and work as a software engineer.</p>

<p>The course of “Fourier analysis” mainly focuses on the idea of mapping a function in the time domain to the one in the frequency domain. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>I did not realize the usefulness in signal processing until I did a research on the compress algorithm of MP3, which is a file format to store sound wave in file system. When computer records a sound, first it receives the sound wave via a microphone. The sound becomes electronic signals and after processed by sound card, it is saved into file system with the original format WAV. Fourier transformation can convert the original signals (in the time domain) into a series of numbers which represent offsets on different frequencies. In this way, MP3 has enormous compression rate compared to the WAV format and therefore nowadays a portable music player is able to keep thousands of songs.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In addition, with the help of Fourier transformation, we can analyze tones of music. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>For example, there is a popular application on mobile phone, which is able to match a pop song from its huge music library after analyzing the sound wave from microphone.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, to achieve a higher compression rate, MP3 conversion will discard parts of tones with high frequency that is hardly audible for human beings. So it is not a lossless format and is not suitable for hi-fi equipment.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Another example is from the course of “linear algebra”, which focuses on the calculation of matrices and vectors. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>In my current work, we maintain an image application for medical study, which can help radiologists diagnose diseases. If the image is 3D, there will be a picture-in-picture alongside, which is a 2D projection by the following transformation:<br><figure class="highlight plain"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><div class="line">1</div><div class="line">2</div><div class="line">3</div></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><div class="line">[ x ]   [ 1, 0, 0 ] </div><div class="line">[ y ] x [ 0, 1, 0 ] </div><div class="line">[ z ]</div></pre></td></tr></table></figure></p>
<p>There are other transformations such as reversing, rotating and enlargement. In theory, an image can be enlarged unlimitedly. But in practice, the limit is the pixel dense of the original image file. If the image has to be enlarged over that limit, the transformation has to fill in extra pixels depending on detailed algorithms, which can cause a fuzzy outcome.</p>
<h2 id="Statistical-variability"><a href="#Statistical-variability" class="headerlink" title="Statistical variability"></a>Statistical variability</h2><p>As a software developer, one of my responsibilities is to analyze performance data and fine-tune source accordingly. In my current job, the connectivity module that I maintain has two separate processors: one for Admit Discharge Transfer (ADT) message, the other for Order Message (ORM). They are different processors and should have no dependency. </p>
<p>From the result of performance data, the processing time of them has a rather high correlation: 0.5. So I investigated in this direction and found that near the end of processing, both processors will trigger an asynchrony downstream workflow, which shares a common code base and had a performance issue. </p>
<blockquote>
<p>So it explains the unexpected high correlation and the finding is based on the knowledge of “probability and statistics” course.</p>

<p>I use the knowledge of “probability and statistics” in another fine-tuning of software performance. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>I designed an in-memory component which in rare cases could fail to notify other nodes in a cluster environment of the latest change in database, and which in turn can cause unsynchronized error. Now a workaround is that we add a check to the nodes to synchronize with database at regular intervals. I need to give an analysis on how long we need to set the interval to reduce the probability of error to a certain level.</p>
<p>Suppose we know the probability of the notification failure P(N) and the notification success P(N’), then the probability of the error has the following expression:<br><figure class="highlight plain"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><div class="line">1</div></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><div class="line">P(E) = P(E|N)P(N) + P(E|N’)P(N’) (E2.4.1)</div></pre></td></tr></table></figure></p>
<p>When the notification works, it is impossible to have this error. So the expression E2.4.1 can be simplified to:<br><figure class="highlight plain"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><div class="line">1</div></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><div class="line">P(E|N) = P(E) / P(N) (E2.4.2)</div></pre></td></tr></table></figure></p>
<p>Before we add the check, P(E|N) = 1. With the timely check, there is still a probability of getting error because:<br><code>P(E|N) = (T – 2a * T / t) / T</code> (a is a short interval that is regarded as an acceptable period to wait for data synchronization; t stands for the target interval; T stands for a given period of time unit, e.g., a minute or an hour). The expression E2.4.2 can be further simplified to:<br><figure class="highlight plain"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><div class="line">1</div></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><div class="line">P(E|N) = (t – 2a) / t. (E2.4.3)</div></pre></td></tr></table></figure></p>
<p>Suppose we want to reduce the error level to 1%. And suppose 2 seconds is the acceptable waiting time, then:<br><figure class="highlight plain"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><div class="line">1</div></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><div class="line">t &lt;= 2a / (1 – 1%) = 4 / 0.99 (s) (E2.4.4)</div></pre></td></tr></table></figure></p>
<p>So the solution is the node needs to perform the check every 4 seconds.</p>
<p>I learned multivariate calculus in mathematics course, which has the following use in the management of software projects. I am the team leader of a group of software developers. I notice that the overall story points (an indicator used in Scrum methodology to measure performance) of the team in a certain period of time is a function of working hours H and expenditure E (including labour costs, entertainment fee, and so on): P(H, E).</p>
<p>Now suppose the marginal point of working hours is proportional to the overall performance per working time:<br><figure class="highlight plain"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><div class="line">1</div></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><div class="line">∂ P / ∂ H = a * (P / H) (a is a constant) (E2.4.5)</div></pre></td></tr></table></figure></p>
<p>When E remains the same (E₀), it becomes a differential equation:<br><figure class="highlight plain"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><div class="line">1</div></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><div class="line">P(H, E₀) = k * Hª (E2.4.6)</div></pre></td></tr></table></figure></p>
<p>Similarly, from the partial derivative for expenditure E, we get:<br><figure class="highlight plain"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><div class="line">1</div></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><div class="line">P(H₀, E) = m * Eᵇ (E2.4.7)</div></pre></td></tr></table></figure></p>
<p>Combine E2.4.6 and E2.4.7, we get:<br><figure class="highlight plain"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><div class="line">1</div></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><div class="line">P(H, E) = k * m * Hª * Eᵇ (E2.4.8)</div></pre></td></tr></table></figure></p>
<p>Suppose it conforms to the Cobb-Douglas Production Function (suppose a + b = 1), the final equation is:<br><figure class="highlight plain"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><div class="line">1</div></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><div class="line">P(H, E) = c * Hª * E¹⁻ª (c is a constant) (E2.4.9)</div></pre></td></tr></table></figure></p>
<p>With the help of E2.4.9, I have quantitative knowledge of team’s performance and understand how to arrange resource to achieve team’s potential.</p>
<h2 id="Differential-equations-in-time-dependent-processes"><a href="#Differential-equations-in-time-dependent-processes" class="headerlink" title="Differential equations in time-dependent processes"></a>Differential equations in time-dependent processes</h2><blockquote>
<p>Differential equation is one of the most important applications of calculus (“advanced mathematics”). </p>
</blockquote>
<p>We can describe a phenomenon with a differential equation. With the analysis to sample data, we can find a formula for the equation and display it with graphics. It is very useful for software development.</p>
<p>For example, modern CPU has multi-cores, which enables Operating System (OS) to create hundreds of threads to process data simultaneously. But each thread needs extra resource and switching among them too frequently can cause performance penalty. Therefore for a fully loaded web server, a technical question is how many threads we should configure in thread pool to make maximum use of the capability of hardware.<br>Supposing that very few threads exist when sever starts up and we set this moment as the start time. Gradually, external requests start coming and the server starts creating new threads to serve them. Depending on different OS, some have specific algorithms to create a number of new threads to serve concurrent requests. Supposing that the change rate of threads is proportional to the thread number, we have:<br><figure class="highlight plain"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><div class="line">1</div></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><div class="line">d(C) / d(t) = a * C (C stands for thread number, a is a constant) (E2.5.1)</div></pre></td></tr></table></figure></p>
<p>After a certain period of time when the thread number reaches a threshold, the thread number increases slowly and finally stops growing. The underlying reason is that all threads are busing with data processing and the average processing time becomes increasing so that it seems that CPU has not enough resource to create new thread. So in this case, the growth rate of threads will drop and the expression of the change rate of the thread number becomes:<br><figure class="highlight plain"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><div class="line">1</div></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><div class="line">d (C) / d(t) = a * C ( 1 - C/H) (H stands for the threshold) (E2.5.2)</div></pre></td></tr></table></figure></p>
<p>The meaning of this equation is when C is small enough, the growth rate is close to a * C. As C grows, the rate becomes slower and finally stops growing. After solving this equation, we get a function in time domain of the thread number:<br><figure class="highlight plain"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><div class="line">1</div></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><div class="line">C (t) = H (1 + b * e ⁻ªᵗ)⁻¹ (b = (H - C₀) / C₀ (C₀ is the figure of thread number at the start time) (E2.5.3)</div></pre></td></tr></table></figure></p>
<p>We also know that <code>lim C(t) = H (when t -&gt; ∞)</code>. With the help of this equation, we know how many threads should be initialized in thread pool to have the best performance. We also know how many servers we need to set up as a cluster to handle large number of requests.</p>
